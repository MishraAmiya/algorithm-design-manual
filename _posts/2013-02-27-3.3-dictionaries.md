title: 3.3 Dictionaries
---

* the dictionary abstract data type permits access to data items by content
* items added to a dictionary can be found by their key

## Dictionary operations

* search – given a search key, return a pointer to the element whose key value is k (if one exists)
* insert – given an element and it's key add it to the dictionary
* delete - given an element remove it form the dictionary
* max, min - certain implementations support efficient retrieval of the largest/smallest key from the dictionary
* predecessor, successor - certain implementations support efficient retrieval of the item immediately before/after a given key (in sorted order) from the dictionary
* different implementations provide better/worse running time guarantees for different operations

## Unsorted array dictionary implementation

* search - O(n) - checking the key against each element (potentionally)
* insert - O(1) - just add the element at the end
* delete - O(1) - pointer is given to element to remove, overwrite position with last element
* min/max - O(n) - requires linear sweep through the elements
* predecessor/successor - O(n) - requires linear sweep through the elements

## Sorted array dictionary implementation

* search - O(log n) - using binary search
* insert - O(n) - because making room for the new item
* delete - O(n) - because filling the hole left by the deletem item
* min/max - O(1) - first and last element
* predecessor/successor - O(1) - elements in previous/next positions
