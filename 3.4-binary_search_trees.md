# Binary search trees

* doubly-linked lists supported insertion and deletion in O(1) but linear query time
* sorted lists support logarithmic query time but linear time update
* binary search tree: **fast search and flexible update**
* two pointer for each element: the median elements above and below the given node
* a rooted **binary tree** is recursively defined as either
    * (1) being empty, or
    * (2) consisting of a node called the root, together with two rooted binary trees called the left and right subtrees
* a **binary search tree** labels each node in a binary tree such that for any node labeled x:
    * all nodes in the left subtree of x have keys < x
    * all nodes in the right subtree of x have keys > x
* nodes have a left and right pointer field (optional parent pointer) and a data field

### searching

* start at the root
* unless root is what we're looking for proceed either left or right depending upon whether x occurs before or after the root key
* runs in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree

### minimum and maximum

* the minimum element must be the leftmost descendent of the root
* the maximum element must be the rightmost descendent of the root
* runs in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree

### tree traversal

* listing the labels of the tree nodes
* in-order: recursively
    * process left subtree first
    * then process actual item
    * process right subtree last
* pre/post order by moving actual item before/after processing subtrees

### insertion

* there is only one place to insert an item x into a binary search tree T where we know we can find it again
* we must replace the NULL pointer found in T after an unsuccessful query for the key k
* take care to assign the correct left/right pointer
* runs in O(h) time where h is the height of the tree

### deletion

* three cases
* leaf node: zero children, simply remove it
* node with one child: replace node with child
* node with two children: relabel this node with the key of its immediate successor (leftmost descendant in the right subtree)
* TODO: add actual delete algorithm
* takes at most two searches and some contant time: O(h)

### performance

* best case if the tree is perfectly balanced:  h = log(n)
* worst case: inserting elements in sorted order: h = n
* based on all n! orderings there's a high probablity to get a log(n) tree
* randomization can be helpful

### balanced search trees

* worst case out of our hands as it depends on **user input**
* insert/delete can be implemented in a way that adjusts after each operation
* keeps the tree close enough to be balanced so the max height is logarithmic
* all dictionary operations (search, insert, delete) take O(log n) time
* concrete implementations: red-black trees, avl trees, splay trees
