title: Algorithm analysis

Algorithms can be understood and studied in a language- and machine-independent manner. We want to compare the efficiency of algorithms without implementing them.
Two tools for this are the **RAM model of computation** and **asymptotic analysis of worst-case complexity (big Oh)**

## The RAM model of computation

* each simple operation (+, \*, -, =, if, call) takes exactly one time step
* loops and subroutines are the composition of many single-step operations (number of time steps depend on the number of iterations or nature of subroutine)
* each memory access takes exactly one time step


## Best, Worst, and Average-Case Complexity

To analyze the complexity of an algorithm we must know how it works over **all** instances.

* The worst-case complexity of the algorithm is the function defined by the maximum number of steps taken in any instance of size n. This is generally the mopst important.

* The best-case complexity of the algorithm is the function defined by the minimum number of steps taken in any instance of size n.

* The average-case complexity of the algorithm, which is the function defined by the average number of steps over all instances of size n.

These time complexities define a numerical function, representing time versus problem size. These are tipically so complex that we need to simplify them.
