# Dictionaries

* the dictionary abstract data type permits access to data items by content
* items added to a dictionary can be found by their key

## Dictionary operations

* search - given a search key, return a pointer to the element whose key value is k (if one exists)
* insert - given an element and it's key add it to the dictionary
* delete - given an element remove it form the dictionary
* max, min - certain implementations support efficient retrieval of the largest/smallest key from the dictionary
* predecessor, successor - certain implementations support efficient retrieval of the item immediately before/after a given key (in sorted order) from the dictionary
* different implementations provide better/worse running time guarantees for different operations

## Dictionary implementations

In practice dictionaries are implemented with binary search trees or hashtables but it's interesting to have a look at how we would implement them using array or linked lists.

### unsorted arrays

* search - O(n) - checking the key against each element (potentionally)
* insert - O(1) - just add the element at the end
* delete - O(1) - pointer is given to element to remove, overwrite position with last element
* min/max - O(n) - requires linear sweep through the elements
* predecessor/successor - O(n) - requires linear sweep through the elements

### sorted arrays

* search - O(log n) - using binary search
* insert - O(n) - because making room for the new item
* delete - O(n) - because filling the hole left by the deletem item
* min/max - O(1) - first and last element
* predecessor/successor - O(1) - elements in previous/next positions

### linked lists

A linked list can be singly or doubly linked and sorted or unsorted. This has effects on the running time of the various dictionary operations.

* search - have to sweep through all elements in all cases (O(n))
* insert - items can simply be added at the end of the unsorted list (O(1)) but have to find their place in the sorted list
* delete - we have to find the element before the element to delete to update to pointers, O(1) in doubly linked lists but has to do a linear sweep for singly linked
* successor is O(1) in sorted lists
* finding the precedessor is O(1) in doubly linked sorted lists
* minimum - sits at the head of the sorted lists (O(1))
* maximum - maintaining a pointer to the last element (tail) makes it O(1) in sorted lists
     * on insertion check if we inserted in the last position (last->next still null)
     * on delete in doubly linked lists if deleting last update the tail pointer to its precedessor
     * delete in singly lists is already linear so adding an extra linear sweep to update the tail pointer doesn't do any harm
