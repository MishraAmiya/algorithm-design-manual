title: 1.4 Modeling the Problem
---

* modeling translates a real-world application into an abstract model which consists of procedures on fundamental structures
* a precisely described model allow you to re-use well-understood solutions from algorithms literature
* certain problems can be modeled in several different ways
* be alert for how the details of your applications differ from your model

## Combinatorial Objects

* **Permutations** – arrangements, or orderings, of items (“arrangement” “tour” “ordering” or “sequence” )

* **Subsets** – selections from a set of items (“cluster“ “collection” “committee” “group” “packaging” or “selection”)

* **Trees** – hierarchical relationships between items (“hierarchy” “dominance relationship” “ancestor/descendant relationship” or “taxonomy”)

* **Graphs** – relationships between arbitrary pairs of objects (“network” “circuit” “web” or “relationship”)

* **Points** – locations in some geometric space (“sites” “positions” or “locations.)

* **Polygons** – regions in some geometric spaces (“shapes” “regions” or “boundaries”)

* **Strings** - sequences of characters or patterns. (“text” “characters” “patterns” or “labels”)

## Recursive Objects

Big things that are made from smaller things of exactly the same type as the big thing. A **decomposition rule** describes how to get smaller things from big things.

As all combinatorial objects above are recursive objects here are a few possible decompositon rules for them:

* Permutations – Deleting the first/last element of a permutation

* Subsets - Deleting an element n if present

* Trees - Deleting the root (results in a set of subtrees), deleting a leaf (a smaller tree)

* Graphs - Deleting a vertex, dividing vertices to groups

* Point - divide them to groups

* Polygons – Inserting any internal chord between two nonadjacent vertices

* Strings - Deleting a character (first or last)

Decompositon has to stop at the smallest and simplest objects. These objects are called **base case**s. (e.g single vertex graph, empty string or subset, simplest polygon: triangle)
